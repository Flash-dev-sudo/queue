Great — let me walk you through exactly **how the order screen UI should be structured** for smooth operation at the front desk. This includes menu layout, pricing, category navigation, and the order summary. This will serve both your **cashier** and your **customer** efficiently.

## 🖥️ **Order Screen Layout (Reception/Front Counter)**

The screen is usually split into two main **panes**:

---

### 🔹 **LEFT PANEL: Menu & Item Selector**

#### 📂 **Category Tabs (Top or Sidebar)**

Use tabs or buttons to divide the menu logically:

```
[ Starters ] [ Burgers ] [ Pizzas ] [ Platters ] [ Wraps ] [ Shakes & Drinks ] [ Desserts ]
```

These categories are based on your menu structure. When a tab is clicked, it updates the visible list below.

#### 📋 **Menu Items Grid/List**

Each category shows:

* **Item name**
* **Price**
* **+ / -** buttons to increase quantity
* Optional: A small image (optional but great for UX)

**Example (inside Starters Tab):**

| Item              | Price | Qty             |
| ----------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Chips             | £2.50 | \[ - ] 1 \[ + ] |
| Peri Peri Chips   | £3.00 | \[ - ] 0 \[ + ] |
| Chips with Cheese | £4.00 | \[ - ] 2 \[ + ] |

**Optional Features**:

* **Search Bar** to quickly find items
* **Modifiers popup** (e.g., “no mayo”, “extra cheese”)

### 🔹 **RIGHT PANEL: Order Summary + Billing**

#### 📦 **Order Summary**

Shows real-time updates as cashier adds items:

```
Order #114
-------------------------
1x Chicken Fillet Burger      £3.50
2x Chips with Cheese          £8.00
1x Oreo Shake                 £3.50

Subtotal                      £15.00
Tax (e.g. 10%)                £1.50
Total                         £16.50
```

#### 💳 **Action Buttons**

* **\[Tap to Pay]** – opens card/tap payment flow
* **\[Send to Kitchen]** – sends the order instantly to KDS
* **\[Print Receipt]** (optional)
* **\[Cancel] / \[Clear]** buttons

---

### 🛠️ **How to Set Prices**

* Each item has a base price
* Toppings/modifiers can be add-ons:

  * e.g., Add cheese (+£0.50), Make it a meal (+£1.80)

Prices can be stored in a backend like:

* Google Sheets (AppSheet)
* Supabase/Firebase (Appsmith/custom app)

The UI simply **reads and displays these values** in real-time.

### 🪄 **User Flow (Receptionist)**

1. Tap `Burgers` > Select “Chicken Fillet Burger” > Add 1 qty
2. Tap `Starters` > “Chips with Cheese” > Add 2 qty
3. Tap `Shakes` > “Oreo” > Add 1 qty
4. Order shows up in right panel
5. Tap **Tap to Pay** → complete transaction
6. Tap **Send to Kitchen**

### 🧱 UI Design Tips

* Use **large touch-friendly buttons** (good for tablet)
* Fonts: Clear, high-contrast
* Layout: Grid layout (3-4 columns of items per category)
* Highlight current category
* Keep right panel sticky so cashier never loses the order view

Would you like me to:

* Design the **actual UI as a wireframe**?
* Or generate an **AppSheet/Appsmith prototype**?

Let me know how hands-on you'd like to go next.
